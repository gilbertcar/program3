Errors and Fixes in IglooScore1:

   if (score1 < score2)
      s = score1;  //Original Statement: s = score2; Function works by subtracting lowest score from total of all 3 scores. s should not be assigned to highest value. 
Correction: s = score1
     
    else
       s = score2;  //Original Statement: s = score1; To continue fix of statement at line 40, s should be assigned to lowest value in comparison. 
Correction: s = score2




Errors and Fixes in IglooScore2:

s2 = score3; //Original statement: s2 = score2; 
Correction: s2 should = score3.

Overall Score Method:   //Error: If 2 values are the same and 1 is different, score is not calculated correctly. 
Correction:
       //Also accounts for 3 equal scores.

		  public int overallScore()
		  {
		    //Initialized s1 and s2 to 0
		    int s, s1 = 0, s2 = 0;
		    if (score1 < score2 && score1 < score3) {
			s1 = score2;
			s2 = score3;
		    } else if (score2 < score1 && score2 < score3 ) {
			s1 = score1;
			s2 = score3; //Original statement: s2 = score2; 
		Correction: s2 should = score3.
		
	    } else if (score3 < score1 && score3 < score2) {
			s1 = score1;
			s2 = score2;
		    }
		    //Error: If 2 values are the same and 1 is different, score is not 			calculated correctly. 
		Correction: New else-if statements:
		      else {
			  if(score1 == score2 && score1 < score3){
			      s1 = score1;
			      s2 = score3;
			  } else if(score2 == score3 && score2 < score1){
			      s1 = score2;
			      s2 = score1;
			  } else{
			      s1 = score1;
			      s2 = score2;
			  }

		    }
		    s = s1 + s2;
		    return s;
